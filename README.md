# pySCu3
Paleomagnetic tool to apply Small Circle methods

To understand pySCu, please read Calv√≠n et al., (2017), pySCu: a new python code for analyzing remagnetizations directions by means of Small Circle utilities, Comput. Geosci., 109, doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2017.07.002.

You can install python3 in different ways. An easy way is using Anaconda. The workflow of pySCu is similar to other PmagPy programs (https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/)
